# bitwise

The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1. If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0.

In C Programming, the bitwise AND operator is denoted by &.

Let us suppose the bitwise AND operation of two integers 12 and 25.

12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
25 = 00011001 (In Binary)

Bit Operation of 12 and 25
  00001100
& 00011001
  ________
  00001000  = 8 (In decimal)
  
  Bitwise OR Operator |
The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1. In C Programming, bitwise OR operator is denoted by |.

12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
25 = 00011001 (In Binary)

Bitwise OR Operation of 12 and 25
  00001100
| 00011001
  ________
  00011101  = 29 (In decimal)
